Hi! I'm Harshith Bandari, a computer science student who enjoys learning about technology, coding, and cybersecurity. I like solving challenges, exploring how things work, and building small projects to improve my skills.

This blog is where I share what I learn â€” from programming tips to security write-ups. I'm still learning and growing, and I use this space to track my progress and hopefully help others along the way.

Thanks for visiting!
