# 🔐 Challenge: Secrets

## 📝 Description
> We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?

---

## 🧭 Approach

1. **Open the challenge website**.
2. **View the source code** using `Ctrl + U`.  
   You’ll notice a relative path like:
        `secret/assets/index.css`
3. Try visiting the directory:  
    `/secret/`
    📄 You’ll see a message:
        "You almost found me. You are doing well"

4. **Check the source code** again (`Ctrl + U`) — you’ll find another path:
    `hidden/file.css`
5. Go to:
    `/hidden/`
    You’ll see:
        "Login with social media or manually"

6. **View the source code** again — you’ll see:
    `superhidden/login.css`

7. Navigate to:
    `/superhidden/`
    The message now says:
    "Finally you found me. But can you see me?"

8. Check the **source code** one last time — and there is your **flag**!

## 📂 Bonus: What's the difference between `/secret` and `/secret/`?

Understanding this helped solve the challenge:

| URL             | Meaning                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/secret/`      | Refers to a **directory**. The server looks for files like `index.html` inside it. |
| `/secret`       | Treated as a **file** (like `secret.html`, `secret.php`, or a script). If it doesn’t exist, it may return 404 or redirect to `/secret/`. |

💡 Always try the **directory version** with `/` if the plain path doesn’t work — especially when exploring hidden paths.

## 💡 Takeaway

This challenge teaches us to:
- Inspect the **source code carefully** — clues often hide there.
- Explore **directory paths** by trimming or changing URLs.
- Understand how **web servers interpret URLs** differently based on trailing slashes.
