# 🏴 Capture The Flag (CTF) – Beginner Guide for Web Exploitation

**CTF** (Capture The Flag) is a fun and challenging event or platform where you need to **find hidden "flags" (secret codes)** by exploring websites, files, or systems. These challenges help you think like a hacker and improve your cybersecurity skills.

---

## 🛠️ Tools You Should Know

When working on **Web Exploitation** CTF challenges, get comfortable with these tools:

- 🔍 [**Burp Suite**](https://portswigger.net/burp): A web proxy tool that helps you intercept, analyze, and manipulate HTTP requests and responses.
- 🛡️ [**OWASP ZAP**](https://www.zaproxy.org/): An open-source alternative to Burp Suite used for scanning and testing web applications.

## 🧠 CTF Player Mindset & Approach

To solve challenges effectively, follow these steps:

### 1. 🔎 View Page Source

- Right-click on the page → “View Page Source” (or press `Ctrl + U`)
- Look for:
  - HTML comments
  - JavaScript functions
  - Hidden flags or clues

---

### 2. 🌐 Explore API Endpoints

- Open Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`)
- Go to the **Network** tab
- Refresh the page and watch how the site makes API calls
- Look for interesting endpoints like:
```bash
    /api/admin
    /api/flag
    /api/debug
   ```
---

### 3. 🧪 Inspect Elements and DevTools Tabs

Use **Inspect Element** (`Ctrl + Shift + I`) to explore:

- `Elements` tab → Check HTML structure
- `Network` tab → Analyze requests and responses
- `Application` tab → Look for:
- Local storage
- Session storage
- Cookies (sometimes contain sensitive info)

---

### 4. 🗂️ Access Hidden or Restricted Files

Check if common sensitive or hidden files are accessible directly from the browser:
```bash
[IMPORTANT] /robots.txt → Lists URLs disallowed to search engines
[CONFIG]   /.htaccess → Apache config file
[MAC]      /.DS_Store → Directory leak on Mac
[REPO]     /.git/config → Might leak repo
[BACKUP]   /backup.zip → Try typical backups
[FLAG]     /flag.txt → Always worth a try 😉
```

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip:

> **Think like a developer who forgot to remove a sensitive file before launching the website.**  
> Ask yourself: "What might they have left behind?"
