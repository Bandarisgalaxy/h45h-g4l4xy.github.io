## üîé Challenge Description
**Description:** Can you decrypt this message? Use the key **"CYLAB"** to decrypt.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

1. First, copy the provided link and download the encrypted file:
   ```bash
   wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/158/cipher.txt
   ```

2. View the contents of the file:
   ```bash
   cat cipher.txt
   ```

3. Inside, you will find the following encrypted text:
   ```
   rgnoDVD{O0NU_WQ3_G1G3O3T3_A1AH3S_cc82272b}
   ```

4. From the challenge description, we know this is encrypted using the **Vigen√®re cipher** with the key **CYLAB**.

5. Copy the encrypted text and open an online Vigen√®re cipher tool, such as [dCode Vigen√®re Cipher Tool](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher).

6. Paste the ciphertext into the input field and provide the key **CYLAB**.

7. Decrypt the message, and the flag will be revealed.

## üìå Takeaway
The Vigen√®re cipher was once considered strong but is now **cryptographically weak** and can be easily broken with modern tools or even frequency analysis. This challenge highlights why **classical ciphers** are not secure for modern cryptography.
