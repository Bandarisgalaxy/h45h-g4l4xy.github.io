### 🕵️  Description:

> The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at?

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Open the Website**  
   First, I visited the challenge website. It showed a simple login form.

2. **Test with Random Credentials**  
   I tried logging in with random usernames and passwords. It failed as expected.

3. **Inspect the Page**  
   Using **Ctrl + U** (View Page Source) and **F12** (Inspect Tool), I explored what was happening behind the scenes.

4. **Hint from the Description**  
   The challenge description mentioned *"log in as Joe"*. So I tried logging in with the username `Joe`.

5. **Check the Cookies**  
   After attempting to log in, I checked the **Application → Cookies** section in the Developer Tools.

6. **Modify the Cookie**  
   There was a cookie with a value set to `false`. I changed it to `true`.

7. **Refresh the Page**  
   After modifying the cookie, I refreshed the page—and boom! The flag appeared 🎉

### 🏁 Final Flag:
<pre>picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_0c98aacc}</pre>

### 💡 What I Learned:

- Always inspect cookies—they can sometimes store useful (or vulnerable) information.
- Modifying cookies manually can sometimes give access to hidden content.
- Small hints in the challenge description can be the key to solving it!
