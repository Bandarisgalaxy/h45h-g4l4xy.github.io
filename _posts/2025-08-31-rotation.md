## üîê Challenge Description
The challenge provides an encrypted text file and asks us to decrypt it to reveal the flag.

---

## üöÄ Approach

### 1. Download the encrypted file
We‚Äôre given a link to the encrypted text file. To download it, we use the **`wget`** command in the terminal:

```bash
wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/386/encrypted.txt
```

- `wget` ‚Üí A command-line tool to download files from the internet.  
- The URL points to the encrypted file provided by the challenge.

---

### 2. View the contents of the file
After downloading, check the content using **`cat`**:

```bash
cat encrypted.txt
```

- `cat` ‚Üí Displays the content of a file on the terminal.  
- Output:

```
xqkwKBN{z0bib1wv_l3kzgxb3l_4k71n5j0}
```

---

### 3. Identify the cipher
We know all PicoCTF flags start with `picoCTF{}`.  
Here, the encrypted text starts with `xqkwKBN{}`.  

That means the text has been shifted using a **Caesar Cipher (rotation cipher)**.

To find the key:
- Encrypted `x` ‚Üí Decrypted `p`.  
- Distance from `x` to `p` = **18 letters backward**.  

So the rotation key is **18**.

---

### 4. Decrypt using `tr` command
Linux has a very handy tool called **`tr` (translate)** which can substitute one set of characters with another.

We can rotate the alphabet by 18 using:

```bash
echo "xqkwKBN{z0bib1wv_l3kzgxb3l_4k71n5j0}" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'S-ZA-Rs-za-r'
```

Breakdown:
- `echo` ‚Üí Prints the given string.  
- `|` ‚Üí Pipes the output of one command into the next.  
- `tr 'A-Za-z' 'S-ZA-Rs-za-r'` ‚Üí Translates:
  - Uppercase `A-Z` shifted by 18 ‚Üí `S-ZA-R`  
  - Lowercase `a-z` shifted by 18 ‚Üí `s-za-r`  

This effectively performs a **Caesar shift of 18**.

### 5. Get the flag
The output is:

```
picoCTF{r0tat1on_d3crypt3d_4c71f5b0}
```

‚úÖ That‚Äôs our flag!

## üîë Key Takeaways
- This was a **Caesar Cipher** challenge with a shift of 18.  
- `wget` helps us download files directly from the challenge.  
- `cat` lets us quickly inspect text files.  
- `tr` is a simple but powerful Linux command to perform substitution ciphers.  
- Always check the format (`picoCTF{}`) to guide decryption.
