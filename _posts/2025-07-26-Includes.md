## 🧩 Challenge Description

Find the flag hidden across multiple files in the website.

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Approach

1. Open the challenge website.  
2. Click the button that says “Say Hello”.  
3. You’ll get an alert saying “Flag is in another file”.  
4. Press `Ctrl + U` to view the page source.  
5. In the source, look for a file named `script.js` and click on it.  
6. Inside `script.js`, you will find the first half of the flag.  
7. To get the second half, open Developer Tools (`F12`) and go to the Network tab.  
8. Refresh the page and look for a request to `style.css`.  
9. Click on `style.css` — it contains the second half of the flag.  
10. Combine both parts to get the full flag.
