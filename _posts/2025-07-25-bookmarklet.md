## ðŸ”– Challenge Description

Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?

## ðŸ§­ Step-by-Step Approach

1. Open the challenge website.  
2. Read the content shown on the page.  
3. Press `Ctrl + U` to open the page source code.  
4. Look for a JavaScript snippet that starts with something like: `javascript:(function() { ... })`
5. Copy that entire JavaScript code.  
6. Open Developer Tools by pressing `F12` and go to the Console tab.  
7. If your browser does not allow pasting, type: `allow pasting`
8. Then paste the copied JavaScript code into the console and press Enter.  
9. âœ… A pop-up alert will appear showing the flag.
